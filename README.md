# detect-for-editor.js
The plugin for detecting some keywords to  show some dialogs to operation in editor

## brower versions

The plugin can run in the brower of chrome, firefox, opera, ie9,ie10.<br>

It can't run in ie11 because some methods of Range can not work in ie11, and I still work hard to resolve.
